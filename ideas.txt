Problem we are trying to solve

"We are using only renewable energy"

But is statement meaningful at all?

Of course you are using renewable energy only because it is cheaper. It does not imply any commitment towards environmental causes, quite the opposite - it may seem like a cynical PR greenwashing. We do not know for sure. In the modern era of post-truth misinformation fake news attention economy hybrid warfare sensemaking meta-crisis it is very difficult (if not impossible) to establish trust. 

We are the people who are watching the watchdogs.

Green credentials of blockchain

If you are in the belief system that technology is boiling the ocean then I encourage you to review the science about the topic.

To begin with, Ethereum is transitioning to proof of stake - no significant hardware expense required, no wasteful proof of work calculations.

Even with proof of work, there has been an evolution in understanding - Bitcoin mining provides 24/7/365 demand for energy that serves as a baseload for energy grid.
